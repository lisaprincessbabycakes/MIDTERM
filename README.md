## What book, album or movie did you choose? What is it about?

For this mid-term project, I wanted to pick Katy Perry's Witness album because (im a huge katycat fan) and that i could see some potential ideas I could explore. The album contains themes of self-awareness, empowerment, and vulnerability, blending electronic pop with personal reflection. A lot of the visuals are futurtistic and abstracts - which makes it a great opportunity fort dynamic and interactive design.

## What aspect of the album will you include in your cover?

I wanna focus on the futuristic and tech-inspired visuals, as well as the idea of "witnessing" personal transformation. I can take inspiration from the album cover. 

## Is it interactive? time-based? both?

As ambitious as it sounds, I kinda want try to incoporate both elements of interactivity and time-based. 

- Eyes as motifs - This is a recurring symbol in witness album. I could potentionally design a interactive cover where the user and "open" or "close" eyes. 
- emotional shifts - the design could react to mouse movements or clicks, with different parts of the cover changing in intensity or color, representing the emotional highs and lows in the album.
- changing colors - over time, the cover could shift between bright, vibrant colors (representing empowerment) and darker tones (representing vulnerability), mimicking the emotional journey in the album.


## What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?

i wanna explore the futuristic aesthetic... maybe i could use sleek, modern shapes or digital glitches to give the cover a futuristic feel that reflects the electronic sound and themes of Witness.

I think the symbolism of the eyes would be a fun to explore, like i could play with the concept of eyes watching or being watched. Maybe the design becomes more intricate or abstract the longer the user interacts with it?

## Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?

perhaps I could draw some inspo from Yoko Ono's Grapefruit for this project, especially with how grapefruit uses simple, poetic instructions to evoke larger meanings and emotions, which might translate beautifully into interactive or time-sensitive elements for my album cover project. Sometimes i gotta remind myself that less is more. 

minmalist interaction and surreal simple visuals are things i can bring into my design process. for an example, the design could start as something simple and blank, with interactions or time will cause subtle changes— like fading shapes, colors, or symbols that represent key themes from the Witness. the cover also could change over time without direct interaction, symbolizing the slow transformation present in both Witness - could be represented by shifts in colors, fading effects, or animated loops, capturing the concept of witnessing personal growth.

or i could look at abstraction when it comes to simplicity - such as shapes that don’t follow typical logic but could represent deeper emotions or concepts in a playful way.
